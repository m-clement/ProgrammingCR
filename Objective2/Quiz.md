## What are `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`? What is the difference between those three commands? Why are there so many required steps to publish your work?

git add updates the main file with the changes made aside in the working tree. Git commit adds the new changes into the main file along with a written message by the person who made the changes as to why the changes were made. Git push finalizes the process by fully integrating it into the main file. There are so many steps because its prevents mistakes from happening and allows for other work to be done between commands.

## What are 'branches' and why would you use them?
