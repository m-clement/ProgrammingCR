# Quiz on Objective 1: Knowledge of Programming History

## What kind of source-code-management (SCM) software is Git? Explain in your own words.

Git is distributed revision control, meaning that there is no centralized system.

## How does one collaborate with others with Git? Provide a general overview.

Git allows users to use repositories and work on a project without having to be anywhere near each other. One user can add to a repository and the other can perhaps make a change and send it back. Since the repository acts somewhat like a cloud, they can constantly reach into it and make new changes regardless where they are.

## What are user-stories? Why are they important?

User stories are a few lines of text written in a format as to better understand how to improve a software product. They are important because they state "As a [balnk] I want to [blank] so that [blank]" which allows the developers to understand what issues need to be changed or added from the point of view of other people in different situations.
