### Objective 3: First program coded and on GitHub

#### Various things we've learned
- NetBeans is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for this project
- Java is a compiled language, which means that humans work with the source which needs to be compiled for the computer to run
- Python, on the other hand, is a intepreted language, which means that it does not need to be compiled for the computer to run it
- A compiled language...
  * likely going to run faster once compiled
  * will not let you run it unless it compiles without errors
- An intepreted language...
  * is not necessarily easier to understand. Whether it is compiled or not has no bearing on how easy the source is to understand
  * may let you run until you hit a runtime compilation error
  * in other words, an intepreted language may compile, but at runtime
