## Various things we've learned
- NetBeans is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for this project
- Java is a compiled language, which means that humans work with the source which needs to be compiled for the computer to run
- Python, on the other hand, is a intepreted language, which means that it does not need to be compiled for the computer to run it
- A compiled language...
  * likely going to run faster once compiled
  * will not let you run it unless it compiles without errors
- An intepreted language...
  * is not necessarily easier to understand. Whether it is compiled or not has no bearing on how easy the source is to understand
  * may let you run until you hit a runtime compilation error
  * in other words, an intepreted language may compile, but at runtime

- Test-Driven Development (TDD) helps us
  * define production code by prototyping them first
  * add more production code by further prototyping more tests
  * preserve existing production code since the tests remain in place

- Python is much more picky about spaces and tabs, and does not require semi colons at the end of each statement. Java is compiled and Python is interpreted, meaning Python runs quicker, but not necessarily faster, but a small error requires overlooking the entire program again. Java requires more steps to run, since it needs to compile.
