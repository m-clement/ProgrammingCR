## Texts, Books, Readings, Materials
- W3 Schools https://www.w3schools.com/
- Wikipedia https://www.wikipedia.org/ 
- Spring website https://spring.io/
- Use of Mac OS and Windows 10

## Grading / Evaluation

A few goals (2-5) and rate appropriately. TBD - more to be established.

Grading will be based on the following established goals:
- Ability to get started on a software product alone
- Ability to break down product development via test-driven-development to protect production code


    If you have chosen a letter grade option, you must include a grading rubric. Clearly describe what needs to be done to earn an A, B, etc.
    If you have chosen a pass/fail option, include the criteria for receiving a passing grade.
    ***If the course will be used to fulfill a graduation requirement, and that content has a common assessment, the student will be required to take the common assessment***

## Documentation of Work

	The whole contents of the work over the semester is entered and saved within git at https://github.com/m-clement/ProgrammingCR.
	This evidence can be reviewed at any time during the course of the semester.

### Checkpoint 1 - before or on March 03, 2017
- Miguel will be sharing his progress with the CR Monitor, Craig Levin, ... when and how ...
