    A week-by-week description of what the student will be doing. List the topics to be covered, activities, assignments, quizzes, and/or tests, If the course is a graduation requirement, note which content expectations will be addressed each week.

## Texts, Books, Readings, Materials
W3 Schools
Wikipedia
Spring website

Use of Mac OS and Windows 10

Consider for specific assignments where a book, resource, or etc is absolutely needed.

## Grading / Evaluation
Need to establish a few goals (2-5) and rate appropriately.

Need this?
Who may I contact for guidance?
Who’s the CR Monitor? Craig Levin


    If you have chosen a letter grade option, you must include a grading rubric. Clearly describe what needs to be done to earn an A, B, etc.
    If you have chosen a pass/fail option, include the criteria for receiving a passing grade.
    ***If the course will be used to fulfill a graduation requirement, and that content has a common assessment, the student will be required to take the common assessment***

## Documentation of Work

    All students must submit evidence of their work to the CR Monitor several times over the course of the semester.
    Explain what the student will be showing to the CR Monitor and how they will get it to the CR Monitor.
