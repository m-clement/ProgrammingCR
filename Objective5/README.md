## Various things we've learned
- bootstrap is a predefined web framework that helps us get started quickly
- it also provides guardrails to prevent us against bad practices

- Java, as a web server, requires that Java and a web server be installed. The web server itself must also run java. Apache HTTPD does not suffice here. We need something like Apache Tomcat, a true java web server.
